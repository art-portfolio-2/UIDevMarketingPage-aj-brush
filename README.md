# UIDevMarketingPage-aj-brush

Single marketing page for the artFolio site.

# Components

Everything goes to index.html but certain elements are generated by JS components.  
To update nav links, "service" sections, or Team Member info simply look for the JSON variable in the file and update with what you'd like. JS will do the rest for you.

# CSS

CSS is written in LESS so every file you need is in the 'less' folder. Major sections of the page are sectioned off in main-page-comps to keep the main file from getting too bulky.
